          <p>
            We are making the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.<br>
            By logging personal hitchhiking experiences, we are trying to paint
            an authentic picture about what hitchhiking is like.
            If you have ever hitchhiked, you are welcome to
            <a href="/trips/new">share your experience with us</a>.
            With the information that you enter here you will be part of the project.
            It will create statistical data and then we can tell the amount of positive/negative
            experiences, average waiting times, your longest/fastest ride, the
            countries where you hitchhiked, and more.
          </p>
