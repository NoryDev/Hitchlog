          The Hitchlog helps hitchhiker to log their hitchhiking experience and gives
          an authentic view on hitchhiking untouched of it's bad reputation that is
          spread by public media/movies and tries to make the world a more
          hitchhiker friendly place.

          <a href='/trips/new'>Log your hitchhiking experiences</a>
          and the Hitchlog paints a picture about what hitchhiking is actually

          A trip is a hitchhiking trip from <b>one city to another city</b> which is
          most of the time just one day.  For longer trips you can continue a trip
          later. That way you will be able to see the waypoints on the map.
