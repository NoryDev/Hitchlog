Hey there,

I have this really weird problem with capistrano/bundler and I am so stuck...
I have two stages: production and staging
when I execute `cap production bundle:install` it works well and runs this:

    executing "cd /var/www/whatever/releases/20110506112617 && bundle install --gemfile /var/www/whatever/releases/20110506112617/Gemfile --path /var/www/whatever/shared/bundle --deployment --quiet --without development test"

everything fine, however when I run `cap staging bundle:install` I get this:

    failed: "sh -c 'cd /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/shared && bundle install --gemfile /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/shared/Gemfile --path /var/www/staging.whatever/shared/bundle --deployment --quiet --without development test'" on whatever.org

It should not be 

    sh -c 'cd /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/shared && bundle install --gemfile /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/shared/Gemfile

but instead

    sh -c 'cd /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/20110506112617 && bundle install --gemfile /var/www/staging.whatever/releases/20110506112617/Gemfile

something is wrong with the current_path and I don't know why... it always points to releases/shared which is totally wrong...

I run capistrano 2.6.0, any help is highly appreciated
