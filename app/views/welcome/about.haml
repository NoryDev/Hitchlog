%h1 About

%p
  Hitchlog is an application that serves as a platform for hitchhikers to log
  their personal hitchhiking experience.
  It gives an authentic view on hitchhiking untouched of it's bad reputation
  that is spread by public media and movies and tries to make the world a more hitchhiker
  friendly place.

%p
  The information that is entered by hitchhikers generates demographic data 
  like the average waiting time in certain countries, longest ride, shortest ride, etc...    
  If you have an idea on interesting features that we could implement, please post it in the 
  Feedback forum on the left.

  is currently developing this site and he is pretty excited about all its possibilities.
  The application is completely open-source and it would be lovely if other people would dive into the project
  and implement their own ideas. So if you feel like coding a feature, don't just wait. Just
  get the code on <a href='http://github.com/flov/hitchhike.me'>Github</a> and start rolling.
  It runs on Ruby on Rails 3 and uses cucumber and rspec for BDD testing.

  There are many ways to contribute to <a href='http://hitchlog.com'>Hitchlog.com</a>.

    Hitchwiki is a wiki just like Wikipedia.
    Hitchhiker from all around the world share tips on how to get out of the city there. 
    It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot and is really useful.

    RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
    to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
    people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
    to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
    we can give away that is representable for our culture.
