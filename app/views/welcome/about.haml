%p
  Hitchhike.me gives an authentic view on hitchhiking. Hitchhikers can log their hitchhiking 
  experience with Photos, stories and other statistical data.

/ .suggest_data
/   - form_tag '/suggest_idea' do
/     = text_field_tag 'name', nil, :placeholder => 'suggest some data'
%p
  This data generates statistical and demographic data e.g. average waiting time, 
  hitchhiked countries, longest ride, shortest ride, etc...
  If you have an idea on interesting data that we could be mining, please post it in the 
  Feedback forum on the left.

  The application is completely open-source and we would love it if other people would dive into the project
  and implement their own ideas. So if you are a ruby on rails developer, you can participate by forking the project at 
  <a href='http://github.com/flov/hitchhike.me'>Github</a>. It runs on Ruby on Rails 3 and uses cucumber and rspec
  for BDD testing.

  %p
    Hitchwiki is a wiki just like Wikipedia.
    Hitchhiker from all around the world share tips on how to get out of the city there. 
    It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot and is really useful.

    RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
    to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
    people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
    to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
    we can give away that is representable for our culture.
