  %h1 About
  %p
    Hitchhiking is an awesome way of traveling!
    <br/>
    Other than getting from A to B, hitchhiking is a lot more than just a way
    of getting from A to B. Hitchhiking enables the traveler to have an eventful
    journey, to shake hands with interesting and generous drivers and to learn
    and experience the diversity of our society along the way.
  %p
    To a person who has never hitchhiked before, hitchhiking might seem weird,
    dangerous or short-minded. The Hitchlog aims at changing this image by
    gathering data of actual hitchhiking experiences by real hitchhikers,
    which, in the end, will paint an authentic picture about what Hitchhiking
    is actually like.
    A picture that is untouched of it's bad reputation which is
    spread by public media/movies
  %p
    The Hitchlog tries to make the world a more
    hitchhiker friendly place.
  %p
    The information that is entered by hitchhikers,
    generates statistical data like the average waiting time, the
    longest/shortest ride of a user, the total number of kilometers hitchhiked
    by a user in for example Mexico, etc...

    The Hitchlog wouldn't be what it is today with the help of Benjamin

    french language.

    %h3 Tramprennen
    %p
      Since 2006 a growing group of hitchhikers are racing around Europe
      by hitchhiking. They are organized in teams and within two weeks
      the teams arrive step by step at a final destiniation.

      %br/
      Since 2008 Tramprennen supports the NGO VivaConAgua. VivaConAgua build clean water
      suplies in third world countries. Together with 96 Teams and 232 attendees,
      Tramprennen managed in 2011 to gather money worth building 6 remarkable
      water suplies around the equator.

    %h3 Hitchwiki
    %p
      Just like Wikipedia, Hitchwiki is a wiki but for hitchhiking.
      Hitchhikers from all around the world share tips and information all around hitchhiking.
      It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot to leave the city and is really useful.

    %h3 Random Roads
    %p
      RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
      to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
      people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
      to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
      we can give away that is representable for our culture.

    The Hitchlog lives off the community and without hitchhikers logging trips
    this application is worthless. Logging previous hitchhiking trips and
    telling some stories is already really helpful. You can also spread the
    word by telling your fellow hitchhiking friends about the site. 
  %p
    At the moment #{link_to "Florian", user_path('flov')} is developing and
    maintaining this application. He is always on the lookout for other
    developers who would like to get involved. Also he gets very happy if
    someone shoots him a mail, telling him that he likes the idea of the Hitchlog.
    %br/
    The application is completely open-source and available on 
    <a href='http://github.com/flov/Hitchlog'>Github</a>
