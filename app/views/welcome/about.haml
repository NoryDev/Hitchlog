  %h1 About

  %p
    The Hitchlog helps hitchhiker to log their hitchhiking experience.
  %p
    It gives an authentic view on hitchhiking untouched of it's bad reputation
    that is spread by public media/movies and tries to make the world a more
    hitchhiker friendly place.
  %p
    The information that is entered by hitchhikers (waiting time, stories,
    routes) generates statistics data like the average waiting time, the
    longest/shortest ride of a user, the total number of kilometers hitchhiked
    by a user in for example Mexico, etc...
  %p
    Stories can be attached to rides so that rides become like blog entries
    telling a bit about the situation, the person and the ride.

  %p
    The Hitchlog lives off the community and without hitchhikers logging trips
    this application is worthless. Logging previous hitchhiking trips and
    telling some stories is already really helpful. You can also spread the
    word by telling your fellow hitchhiking friends about the site.

    %h3 Hitchwiki
    %p
      Hitchwiki is a wiki just like Wikipedia.
      Hitchhiker from all around the world share tips on how to get out of the city there. 
      It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot and is really useful.

    %h3 Viva Con Agua
    %p
      Besides the air we breathe, water is the most fundamental source of life.
      Water creates life, water is life. Water means healthy living, happy
      living. For Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli this is the primary motivation for
      our activities &ndash the funding and implementation of water projects
      around the world and thus enabling people to access clean water.

    %h3 Random Roads
    %p
      RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
      to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
      people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
      to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
      we can give away that is representable for our culture.
