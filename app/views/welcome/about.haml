  %h1 About

  %p
    Hitchlog is an application that serves as a platform for hitchhikers to log
    their personal hitchhiking experience.  It gives an authentic view on
    hitchhiking untouched of it's bad reputation that is spread by public
    media/movies and tries to make the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.

  %p
    The information that is entered by hitchhikers (waiting time, stories,
    routes) generates demographic data like the average waiting time in
    countries, the longest/shortest ride of a user, the total number of
    kilometers hitchhiked by a user in for example Mexico, etc... 

  %p
    Stories can be attached to rides so that rides become like blog entries
    telling a bit about the situation, the person and the ride.

    The Hitchlog lives off the community and without hitchhikers logging trips
    this application is worthless. We can use any help.  Logging previous
    hitchhiking trips and telling some stories is already really helpful. You
    can also spread the word by telling your fellow hitchhiking friends about
    the site. As well we could use designers making some images or comics
    branding the page. If you feel like learning some ruby on rails, 
    #{link_to "Florian", user_path(@flov)} is
    grateful for any help and is also happy to teach some ruby.<br/>
    He is currently developing this site and he is pretty excited about all
    its possibilities. The application is completely open-source.

    %h3 Hitchwiki
    %p
      Hitchwiki is a wiki just like Wikipedia.
      Hitchhiker from all around the world share tips on how to get out of the city there. 
      It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot and is really useful.

    %p
      Besides the air we breathe, water is the most fundamental source of life.
      Water creates life, water is life. Water means healthy living, happy
      living. For Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli this is the primary motivation for
      our activities &ndash the funding and implementation of water projects
      around the world and thus enabling people to access clean water.

    %h3 Random Roads
    %p
      RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
      to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
      people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
      to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
      we can give away that is representable for our culture.
