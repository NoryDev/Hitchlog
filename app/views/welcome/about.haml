%h1 About

%p
  Hitchhike.me is an application that serves as a platform for hitchhikers to log
  their personal hitchhiking experience.
  It aims at giving an authentic view on hitchhiking untouched of it's bad reputation
  that is spread by public media and movies.
  / Hitchhikers can get in touch with other hitchhikers who already have some experience.

%p
  The information that is entered by hitchhikers generates demographic data 
  like the average waiting time in certain countries, longest ride, shortest ride, etc...    
  If you have an idea on interesting features that we could implement, please post it in the 
  Feedback forum on the left.

  The application is completely open-source and we would love it if other people would dive into the project
  and implement their own ideas. So if you are a ruby on rails developer, you can participate by forking the project at 
  <a href='http://github.com/flov/hitchhike.me'>Github</a>. It runs on Ruby on Rails 3 and uses cucumber and rspec
  for BDD testing.

  %p
    Hitchwiki is a wiki just like Wikipedia.
    Hitchhiker from all around the world share tips on how to get out of the city there. 
    It helped many hitchhikers to find a good spot and is really useful.

  %p
    RandomRoads is a printed magazine, one that travels from one person 
    to another, one that travelers can give to their drivers or other 
    people they meet on the road. As such, the magazine is a great way 
    to create further bonding between hitchhikers, and to have something 
    we can give away that is representable for our culture.
