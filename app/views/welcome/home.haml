    %h1 Welcome!
    %p 
      We are making the world a more hitchhiker friendly place.<br />
      By logging personal hitchhiking experiences, we are trying to paint
      an authentic picture about what hitchhiking is like.
      If you have ever hitchhiked, you are welcome to 
      #{link_to 'share your experience with us', new_trip_path}.
      With the information that you enter here you will be part of the project.
      It will create statistical data and then we can tell the amount of positive/negative
      experiences, average waiting times, your longest/fastest ride, the
      countries where you hitchhiked, and more.
  
    %p
      The piechart below consists of the hitchhiked countries that have been logged
      by hitchhikers in the Hitchlog.
