== Hitchhike.me

Hitchhiking is my favorite way of transportation. Whenever I had time to
travel i chose hitchhiking before car pooling and trains. It is a great way
to get in touch with the local population and get a glimpse of the life of 
a completely other personality.
When I managed to go a long tour of about 1000 kms in one day iâ€™ve felt 
energised and quite happy about my day spent on the road, meeting all 
these people coming from different backgrounds.

By making it easy to log these experiences,
this application is a tribute to those people 
and to hitchhiking itself.

== Documenting A Hitchhike

The current flow of documenting a hitchhike:

* log in
* click on new Hitchhike
* Fill in fields: title:string from:string, to:string, photo:image
* a photo
* location from where you where picked up
* location at which you have been dropped off

== Features

* When Uploading an image the app lets you crop it to a unified size so that it fits
  in a slide show displayed at the top of the page.
* The information from where to where you hitchhiked is displayed in a google maps canvas
  right beneath the picture.

== Upcoming Features

* Statistics:
  By telling the app from where to where you went, it creates statistical data, e.g.:
  total amount kilometers travelled, country where you hitchhiked most, etc...
