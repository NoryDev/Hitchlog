Hitchlog
--------

Hitchhiking is my favorite way of transportation. Whenever I had time to
travel i chose hitchhiking before car pooling and trains. It is a great way
to get in touch with the local people and to get a glimpse of the life of 
a completely other personality.
When I managed to go a long tour of about 1000 kms in one day iâ€™ve felt 
energised and quite happy about my day spent on the road, meeting all 
these people coming from different backgrounds. Additionally I also felt that I
deserve to be there more than any other tourist :P

After a while it was quite difficult for me to remember all these different people
and the stories that were connected to it. Additionaly it would have been nice to 
see how much kilometers I made and how much cars I have seen from inside while hitchhiking.

By making it easy to log these experiences,
this application aims at creating a hitchhiking log.
Furthermore the logs can be used to create demographic statistics about hitchhiking:
e.g. how much male/female driver did you hitchhike with, the average waiting time, 
or how much kilometers did you hitchhike, etc...

[Frank Verhart](http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Fverhart) started to document his 
hitchhiking statistics on [hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Fverhart) the idea
of this application is to make it easy to provide an easy way to collect that data
