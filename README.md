Hitchhike.me
----------

Hitchhiking is my favorite way of transportation. Whenever I had time to
travel i chose hitchhiking before car pooling and trains. It is a great way
to get in touch with the local population and get a glimpse of the life of 
a completely other personality.
When I managed to go a long tour of about 1000 kms in one day iâ€™ve felt 
energised and quite happy about my day spent on the road, meeting all 
these people coming from different backgrounds.

After a while it was quite difficult to remember all these different people
and the stories that were connected to it.

By making it easy to log these experiences,
this application aims at creating a hitchhiking log.
Furthermore the logs can be used to create demographic statistics about hitchhiking:
e.g. how much male/female driver did you hitchhike with, the average waiting time, 
or how much kilometers did you hitchhike, etc...

[Frank Verhart](http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Fverhart) started to document his 
hitchhiking statistics on [hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Fverhart) the idea
of this application is to make it easy to provide an easy way to collect that data


Documenting A Hitchhike
-----------------------

The current flow of documenting a hitchhike:

* Log in
* Click on new Hitchhike
* Fill in fields: title:string from:string, to:string, photo:image
* Crop the image
* Submit

Roadmap
-------

Version 0.1:

* User can sign in/out
* User can upload a hitchhike and the geographic information gets parsed properly
* If a picture is attached, the image gets cropped so that it fits into
  a slideshow and the user can choose where it is cropped.
* A Google Map canvas displays the route and the distance travelled

Version 0.2:

* A User can add more information to a hitchhike:
  - several people with whom you rode and information about them: 
    origin, occupation, mission, driver?, male/female
  - waiting time
  - a story which is displayed below the hitchhike.
* Statistics:
  By telling the app from where to where you went, it creates statistical data, e.g.:
  total amount kilometers travelled, country where you hitchhiked most, etc...

Version 0.3:

* Implementation with other sites:
  - combining the [Mediawiki API](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Login) of hitchwiki  with the
    Hitchhike.me Login process
  - API for external pages to use the hitchhike statistics parsed in JSON and XML format
  

Version 0.4:

* A Trip has many hitchhikes and a hitchhike belongs to a trip.
  That way a trip with many hitchhikes can be displayed on one map with a slideshow
  of the pictures of that trip.
