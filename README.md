Hitchlog
--------

Hitchhiking enables you to meet all kinds of different
people, have an eventful journey, learn about your fellow human being by
direct interaction and many more things. On top of it it's free and
heaps of fun (*yay*)

For a person who has never hitchhiked, hitchhiking might seem weird,
short-minded, dangerous or short-minded. To change this image, the
Hitchlog gathers actual hitchhiking experiences and paints an authentic
picture about what Hitchhiking is actually like.
