Hitchhiking enables you to meet heaps of different
people, to have an eventful journey, to learn about your fellow human beings by

direct interaction and many more things. On top of it it's free and
heaps of fun (**yay**)

For a person who has never hitchhiked, hitchhiking might seem weird,
dangerous or short-minded. The 
Hitchlog aims at changing this image by gathering data of actual hitchhiking
experiences which paints an authentic, real
picture about what Hitchhiking is actually like.

Any contribution is highly appreciated!
[Flov](https://github.com/flov/Hitchlog/tree/crisp) can't do all the
work at the moment because most of the time he is traveling and he
doesn't have too much time to sit in front of a screen ;)
