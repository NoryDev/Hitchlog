Hitchlog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flov/Hitchlog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flov/Hitchlog)

Hitchhiking enables the traveller, to have an eventful journey, to learn
more about our fellow human beings and many more things.

# Vision

The hitchlog is a **social network for hitchhikers** which makes
information on previous hitchhiking experiences readily available.
To a person who has never hitchhiked before, hitchhiking might seem dangerous or
short-minded. The Hitchlog aims at changing this image by gathering data
of actual hitchhiking experiences which paints a real picture about what
Hitchhiking is actually like. 

# Contributing to Hitchlog

Any contribution is highly appreciated!
