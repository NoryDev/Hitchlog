    # "OK" indicates that no errors occurred; the address was successfully parsed and at least one geocode was returned.
    # "ZERO_RESULTS" indicates that the geocode was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the geocode was passed a non-existent address or a latlng in a remote location.
    # "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" indicates that you are over your quota.
    # "REQUEST_DENIED" indicates that your request was denied, generally because of lack of a sensor parameter.
    # "INVALID_REQUEST" generally indicates that the query (address or latlng) is missing.
    # "OFFLINE" indicates that you are not online
